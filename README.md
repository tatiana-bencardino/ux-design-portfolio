This is a repository with the UX designs that I have made during my spare time or for university projects.

This repo is devided in multiple folders, each allocated to a specific project. This is a list of the projects and a brief description:

### OREBS
OREBS (Online Room and Equipment Booking Systems) was a project developed during my semester of the Diploma of Software Development. We were ask to start this project for the Faculty of Music and Media, we worked with the head directors of the faculty to understand the requirements of the system. One of the requirements for this web system was that it needed to have a similar look to the CIT webpage.

This are some snippets of the log in page and the main page once an user logs in:
